I'm still a little confused about using my computer's terminal versus my ide terminal.
It seems more effective to use the ide one, but I admit I am relatively new to the whole thing.
The term fork in the context of GitHub basically means copy

my aws ip addy
http://184.73.198.144/
command to remote shell:
ssh -i "C:\Users\becca\OneDrive\Documents\School\CS260\---" ubuntu@260dreams.click
Note also that I am unsure whether my computer actually has ubuntu at all. Not sure if I want to subscribe, either. 
-The class instruction mentioned nothing about it, which could either mean I don't need it, or they expect everyone to already have it.

http = hypertext transport protocol (non-secure)
https = secure version (should always be used/supported nowadays (in anything you build))
when using non-secure connections, anyone with access to the network traffic can capture all data sent in either direction (bad)
SOA = start of authority - a record that provides contact info about the owner of the domain name
the handshake exchanges web certificate which identifies domain name of server creating the secure connection.
the browser compares the certificate domain name to the one repped in the url and if they don't match or if the certificate is invalid, you get a warning display
Web Certificates are generated by a third party. the issuer is responsible for verifying the owner.
HTML = HyperText Markup Language was originally created as a publishing format for web pages, now reps either SPA or MPA
SPA = Single Page Application
MPA = Multi-page application - a group of hyperlinked pages

always include the <!doctype> brackets when coding an html
*it is common to name the main file index in htmls 
an html file is coded by <body>, which has three sections: header, main, and footer. Each section may contain other structural content
A hyperlink in HTML is represented with an anchor (a) element that has an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (href). 
A hyperlink to BYU's home page looks like this: <a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>

Since we now have JavaScript to supplement our htmls, we don't need to include a "form" element, though we can

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
CSS converts structure and content of html to a vibrant, responsive experience
concerned with defining rulesets or rules
rule is comprised of a Selector that selects elements to apply the rule to and Declarations that represent the Property to style  w the property value
the style element should appear in the Head element of the doc
elements inherit the rules applied to their parents
CSS defines everything as boxes
<div>s are automatically defined as boxes in html, too. Can of course be changed from CSS
CSS flex display (display: flex) is useful when you want your content to react to the window size/orientation.

Bootstrap CSS package is good to use for when JS is needed. Bootstrap is very common to use
to  include Bootstrap in your application using NPM you would run the following from your console: npm install bootstrap@5.2.3 (ver num may need to be updated from time to time)

JavaScript = most commonly used language
use keyword "let" or "const" (depending if you want it constant or able to change) to define variables (not "var")
objects can change type based on what you assign to them, they may not necessarily remain the way they were defined (will adapt)
JS supports the regular mathmatical operators (triple === for equality(or !== for not))
    at least for number vars. For strings, only + and ===
    double == is technically usable but can give unexpected results with the complex defining rules.
Can define a string with ', ", or `

Unicode is a thing that helps you support other languages

functions begin with keyword "function"
and, yes, you can declare functions from inside other functions
These two functions are the same:
    // standard function syntax
    a.sort(function (v1, v2) {
        return v1 - v2;
    });
    // arrow function syntax
    a.sort((v1, v2) => v1 - v2);
Return statements with arrow function:
    () => 3;
    // RETURNS: 3
    () => {
        3;
    };
    // RETURNS: undefined
    () => {
        return 3;
    };
    // RETURNS: 3

debounce functions are good for efficiency. They will restrict execution of a function to once per /time-slot/. The time will reset every time the debounce function is called

&nbsp = non-breaking space character. will add a space when typed
