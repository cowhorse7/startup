I'm still a little confused about using my computer's terminal versus my ide terminal.
It seems more effective to use the ide one, but I admit I am relatively new to the whole thing.
The term fork in the context of GitHub basically means copy

my aws ip addy
http://184.73.198.144/
command to remote shell:
ssh -i "C:\Users\becca\OneDrive\Documents\School\CS 260\EquineFloral22.pem" ubuntu@184.73.198.144
Note also that I am unsure whether my computer actually has ubuntu at all. Not sure if I want to subscribe, either. 
-The class instruction mentioned nothing about it, which could either mean I don't need it, or they expect everyone to already have it.

http = hypertext transport protocol (non-secure)
https = secure version
when using non-secure connections, anyone with access to the network traffic can capture all data sent in either direction (bad)
